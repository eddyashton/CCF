Quickstart
==========

First, you should :ref:`setup a CCF-compatible environment <Requirements>`. Then, you will be able to :ref:`build CCF from sources and run CCF test suite <Building CCF>`. Note that for rapid prototyping, you can run a `virtual` build of CCF that does not require Intel SGX.

Once this is done, make sure you get familiar with some of :ref:`CCF concepts`. You will then be able to:

1. :ref:`Create a consortium and agree on the constitution <Member Governance>`
2. :ref:`Develop a CCF application, based on the example logging application <Example App>`
3. :ref:`Start a new CCF network to deploy the application <Starting a New Network>`
4. :ref:`Let the consortium configure and open the network to users <Opening a Network>`
5. :ref:`Have users issue business transactions to the application <Using CCF Applications>`
